# 3F â€• Framework For Femm

Some drawing and analysis code through FEMM 3.3

## How-to quickly:
1. make a copy of the folder 'template_motor'
2. rename it to your taste
3. edit 'motor_data.lua' with your specifications
4. add, change, remove (carefully) materials in 'materials_and_bc.lua'
5. double-click on 3F shortcut (Linux)


## Requirements:
If you're using Linux you have to install Wine and configure FEMM
in '3F/femm33Mar'.


## What if:

### I already have a '.FEM' drawing

Fine, after step 2 read 'yourfolder/README.txt' and follow the instructions.


### I just want to make the drawing

After step 4 modify the variable 'TYPE' inside 'yourfolder/type.sh'
and just put "DRAWING". Continue with step 5.
Wait for it and look for the file 'yourfolder/yourfile.fem'


### After some modifications to the drawing, I want to analise this machine

After step 4 modify the variable 'TYPE' inside 'yourfolder/type.sh'
and just put "ANALYSIS". Continue with step 5.
Wait for it and look for the output file inside 'output/'


### Now I'd like to simulate other things/settings

Make your choices in 'yourfolder/motor_data.lua'. You can find a record
of all the results in 'yourfolder/output/', sorted by the date_time of
launch.


### I'm on Windows

Don't worry, a pretty handy shortcut is coming for Windows too!


### I had a problem during the analysis

Try to look at '3F/log/analysis_date_time.log' and see where it stops.
Then have a look at '3F/temp.fem' to see the last motor analysed.


### I'd like to know what all the options in 'motor_data.lua' means

See '3F/doc/main.pdf' for some of those options.


### I don't understand why you made easy things complex

Generality. A unique framework for the analysis of rotating electrical
machines through FEMM.
Reuse of code. Easy link to optimiser (I hope).
