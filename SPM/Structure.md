# Structure


## drawing
### load motor data
### draw the stator
### draw the rotor
### draw the air-gap


## analyses
Take the drawing and start processing.
If the drawing does not exist, launch it.

### no-load analysis

### on-load analysis
Impose currents in the cicuits.
Typically the current is given in the dq reference frame.
Therefore dq --> AlphaBeta --> abc...m --> slots
           T_dq^AB     T_AB^a...m       K
